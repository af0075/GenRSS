# GenRSS

## Simulations and Corresponding Figures

### simSS
<p align="justify">Simulates the generalized RSS process. This experiment tracks and compares the number of iterations it takes for a player to guess the secret based on graph density. This experiment corresponds to Figure 4.4.</p>

### manyRuns
<p align="justify">Compares the proportion of runs that end in an accurate guess of the secret rather than a guess because a player has no new shares to send. Comparison occurs across graph densities. This experiment corresponds to Figure 4.5.</p>

### changeN
<p align="justify">Compares the number of iterations it takes for a player to guess the seceret as the number of players changes. This experiment corresponds to Figure 4.6.</p>

### changeM
<p align="justify">Compares the number of iterations it takes for a player to guess the seceret as the number of distinct shares changes. This experiment corresponds to Figure 4.7.</p>

### changeT
<p align="justify">Compares the number of iterations it takes for a player to guess the seceret as the threshold changes. This experiment corresponds to Figure 4.8.</p>

### changeStar
<p align="justify">Compares the number of iterations it takes for a player to guess the seceret as the number of particularly sensitive shares changes. This experiment corresponds to Figure 4.9.</p>
